# Master-s-Capstone-Project---Supplier-Performance-Analysis-and-Dashboard
A Data-Driven Framework for Supplier Performance Optimization and Risk Mitigation.
Project Overview: Data-Driven Supplier Optimization

This project establishes a robust, analytical framework for Conagra Brands to evaluate and categorize its supplier network. By leveraging historical performance data and risk metrics, the framework identifies the top 150 suppliers to prioritize for contract renegotiations in the upcoming fiscal year.

The goal is to transition from reactive procurement to proactive partnership management, ensuring supply chain resilience and cost-efficiency.
Supplier Categorization Matrix

The core of the framework is a segmentation model that classifies suppliers into four distinct performance groups based on their strategic value, cost-effectiveness, and reliability.
1. Strategic Partners

These are the "best-in-class" suppliers who demonstrate high reliability and high strategic alignment.

    Characteristics: Consistent on-time delivery, high quality, and collaborative innovation.

    Objective: Form long-term, multi-year contracts and explore joint cost-saving initiatives.

2. Operational Workhorses

These suppliers provide the essential, high-volume goods and services that keep Conagra’s daily operations running.

    Characteristics: Steady performance with competitive pricing, though perhaps lacking specialized innovation.

    Objective: Streamline transactional processes and maintain steady volume commitments.

3. High-Cost Specialists

Suppliers in this category provide unique or niche products but at a premium price point that impacts margins.

    Characteristics: Low availability of alternatives, specialized technology, or rare raw materials.

    Objective: Conduct deep-dive cost analysis and negotiate "value-add" services to justify the premium.

4. High-Risk Liabilities

These suppliers pose a threat to the supply chain due to inconsistent performance or financial/geopolitical instability.

    Characteristics: Frequent delays, quality variances, or high risk-exposure scores.

    Objective: Implement strict Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) or begin the process of phasing them out in favor of more stable alternatives.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The framework utilizes a weighted scoring system to rank the top 150 suppliers, focusing on:
Metric	Description
Quality Score	Percentage of defect-free shipments and adherence to Conagra’s food safety standards.
OTIF (On-Time, In-Full)	Reliability of delivery schedules to prevent production downtime.
Economic Value	Total cost of ownership, including unit price, shipping, and payment terms.
Risk Index	Evaluation of financial health, geographic concentration, and ESG compliance.
Strategic Outcomes

    Optimized Spend: Focused negotiations on the top 150 suppliers allow for greater volume discounts and better terms.

    Enhanced Resilience: By identifying "High-Risk Liabilities" early, Conagra can diversify its sourcing before a disruption occurs.

    Data-Backed Negotiation: Procurement teams enter contract talks with transparent, data-driven scorecards, removing subjectivity from the process.
